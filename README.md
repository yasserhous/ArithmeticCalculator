# ArithmeticCalculator
simple calculator
This is a simple calculator developed as an individual assignment for a course about data structures and algorithms. In this calculator, I used concepts such as the stack data structure, recursive algorithms and many more. To try, you can view examples in the example.txt file to see the format of the expressions. Also, make sure the file containing your arithmetic expressions are outside the src file
